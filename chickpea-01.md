#Chickpea
##*Cicer arietinum*

Chickpea is a cool-season legume first domesticated in the Fertile Crescent and now cultivated worldwide, second only to soybean in terms of area. India is the global leader in both production and consumption of chickpea.

There are about 55,000 [chickpea accessions listed in Genesys][goo]. The two largest collections are at ICRISAT in India and ICARDA in Lebanon, with additional important collections in the USA, Turkey and Russia. More than half (58%) of the listed accessions are traditional cultivars and landraces, with just over 30% as breeding material and improved varieties. Wild relatives currently make up 1.5% of the accessions.

ICARDA and ICRISAT achieved considerable success with [chickpea breeding][icrisat], releasing several varieties with disease resistance and ability to withstand abiotic stresses. These varieties have had considerable [impact in many countries][cgiar]. Most recently, ICARDA and ICRISAT, working with the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research, released [three new varieties][cgiar 2] for high altitude areas that combine early maturity, better yield and resistance  to wilt, root rot and ascochyta blight.

ICARDA led a consortium that sequenced the [chickpea genome][nature], information from which is now part of advanced breeding strategies. ICARDA also provides access to sequence data through [CicArMiSatDB][icrisat 2]
