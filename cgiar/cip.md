# International Potato Center (CIP)

The [CIP genebank][cipotato] in Lima, Peru, is responsible for potatoes and sweetpotatoes and other Andean roots and tubers. The entire collection at CIP is about 19,000 accessions. Genesys lists [3000 accessions maintained _in vitro_][per001-invitro], 2000 of potato and 1000 of sweetpotato. About 63% of these are breeding material or advanced cultivars, while 37% are traditional cultivars or landraces.

The CIP collection is the world's largest _in vitro_ genebank. It likely includes more than 80% of the world's potato and sweetpotato landraces and more than 80% of the known species of wild potato. The CIP genebank also maintains more than 1500 accessions of Andean root and tuber crops. 

From 2002 to 2012 CIP distributed more than 50,000 samples to 100 countries.

Accessions are kept as clonal collections in the field, greenhouses and _in vitro_ (many cryopreserved) and as seeds. CIP is also working with farmers and local organizations in the Andes to conserve crops in farmers' fields. Part of that effort has involved giving varieties back to communities that had lost them. As researchers monitor the changes that take place as farmers grow and adapt these varieties, they also get the opportunity to discover and incorporate new varieties in the collection.

Material from the CIP genebank was instrumental in breeding the [orange-fleshed sweetpotatoes][cipotato 2] that are currently improving nutrition in much of sub-Saharan Africa. These varieties are naturally rich in pre-cursors to vitamin A, and as part of the daily diet can prevent vitamin A deficiency.

A unit for the detection and elimination of pathogens enables the CIP genebank to distribute healthy material. CIP was the first genebank to be accredited by the International Standards Organization (ISO 17025) for safe and secure germplasm movement.

About 75% of CIP's seed accessions are safety duplicated in the form of [true seed in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault][per001-sgsv]. Additional safety duplicates are in Brazil and Peru and at CIAT in Colombia.
