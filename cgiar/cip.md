The [CIP genebank][cipotato] in Lima, Peru, is responsible for potatoes and sweetpotatoes and other Andean roots and tubers. The entire collection at CIP is about 16,000 accessions. Genesys lists the 3000 accessions maintained *in vitro*, 2000 of potato and 1000 of sweet potato. About 63% of these are breeding material or advanced cultivars, while 37% are traditional cultivars or landraces.

The CIP collection is the world's largest *in vitro* genebank. It includes more than 80% of the worldâ€™s potato and sweetpotato landraces and more than 80% of the known species of wild potato. The CIP genebank also maintains more than 1500 accessions of Andean root and tuber crops. About 15,000 samples have been distributed to 94 countries.

Accessions are kept as clonal collections in field and *in vitro* (many cryopreserved) and as seeds. CIP is also working with farmers and local organizations in the Andes to conserve crops in farmers' fields. Part of that effort has involved giving varieties back to communities that had lost them. As researchers monitor the changes that take place as farmers grow and adapt these varieties, they also get the opportunity to discover and incorporate new varieties in the collection.

Material from the CIP genebank was instrumental in breeding the [orange-fleshed sweet potatoes][cipotato 2] that are currently improving nutrition in much of sub-Saharan Africa. These varieties are naturally rich in pre-cursors to vitamin A, and as part of the daily diet can prevent vitamin A deficiency.

A unit for the detection and elimination of pathogens enables the CIP genebank to distribute healthy material. CIP was the first genebank to be accredited by the International Standards Organization (ISO 17025) for safe and secure germplasm movement.

About {==82% of CIP's accessions==}{>>Again, huge discrepancy with 45% figure on Crop Trust website. JC<<} are safety duplicated in the form of true seed in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. Additional safety duplicates are in Brazil and Peru and at CIAT in Colombia.
