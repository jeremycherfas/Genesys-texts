# World Agroforestry Center (ICRAF)

The [ICRAF genebank][worldagroforestry] in Nairobi, Kenya, conserves the diversity of a wide range of agroforestry tree species, most of which are a source of food or forage. Accessions are stored as seed and in field genebanks in the regions where ICRAF works.

The seed genebank currently holds almost 5400 accessions of about 150 species. Of these, information on 4300 is available through Genesys. Seed is maintained in an active collection at 4Â°C, and for long-term conservation ICRAF works with the Millennium Seed Bank in the United Kingdom and the Kunming Institute of Botany in China.

Conservation of tree species poses special difficulties, including the large number of genera -- each with specific requirements -- long generation times and seeds that often cannot be dried for conventional storage. As a result, ICRAF has to maintain decentralised field genebanks. These field genebanks both conserve diversity and offer a source of sexual and clonal reproductive material. The field genebanks are also research sites for evaluation and characterisation. Overall, 60 diverse tree and shrub species are maintained in field genebanks spread across 16 countries.

The seed and field genebank supply germplasm for ICRAF's research to domesticate some species, and to others wanting access to agroforestry plant genetic resources.

Just over {==3% of the seed accessions==}{>>Discrepancy with Crop Trust figure of 10% JC<<} are safety duplicated at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. About 8% of the accessions are also safety duplicated in China.

A database -- the [Agroforestry Species Switchboard][worldagroforestry 2] -- gives access to "information sources to support tree research and development activities"
