# Africa Rice Center (AfricaRice)

The [genebank of AfricaRice][africarice] is in Cotonou, Benin, where the centre had a temporary headquarters until late {==2015==}{>>Is it moving back to Abidjan?JC<<}. The collection contains close to 20,000 accessions, the vast majority of them (78%) _Oryza sativa_, Asian rice. Accessions of the African species _O. glaberrima_, however, which form 17% of the collections, are crucial to the breeding of varieties able to perform well under the conditions of sub-Saharan Africa.

About 60% of the accessions are traditional cultivars or landraces, and just under 40% are breeding and research lines. The remainder are mostly wild species.

The base collection at Cotonou, is in medium-term storage at 5-10°C. In addition, AfricaRice has three {==complete==}{>>From AfricaRice website; conflict with info in genesys. JC<<} duplicates in long term storage at around -20°C, in Ibadan, Nigeria, at Fort Collins, USA, and in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway.

The genebank, with its wide range of rice diversity, was a crucial element in the development of very succesful Nerica varieties. Much of the research at AfricaRice is focused on screening accessions for their ability to tolerate stresses such as heat and drought and pests and diseases, all of which are expected to increase under climate change.

AfricaRice is spearheading regional characterisation and evaluation efforts throughout sub-Saharan Africa, working with the [INGER-Africa][africarice 2] network and national programmes throughout Africa. Other work includes the restoration of lost germplasm after civil strife, provision of conservation services to NARS, and training and capacity building.

The AfricaRice Genebank Information System ([ARGIS][africarice 3]) holds information on more than 19,000 accessions and is publicly available.
