# International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT)

[CIMMYT's genebank][cimmyt] near Texcoco, Mexico, primarily houses collections of maize and wheat. The [wheat collection][adobe], with about 140,000 accessions from 140 countries, is the largest in the world. The [maize collection][adobe 2] of 28,000 accessions includes the world's largest collection of maize landraces.

Total [holdings in Genesys][mex002] number more than 164,000. Of these, 47% are advanced cultivars and breeders' lines, 34% are traditional cultivars or landraces, and almost 5% are wild relatives. About 120,000 samples have been distributed to 64 countries.

A key role for the genebank, at CIMMYT as elsewhere, is to identify potentially valuable accessions to use in specific breeding programmes. Most recently, for example, breeders sourced material from the CIMMYT collections to look for [resistance to a maize disease called tar spot complex][cimmyt 2] and for resistance to wheat blast, an emerging wheat disease.

CIMMYT's accessions have helped to populate two important databases that tabulate molecular characterisation data for wheat and for maize.

About 37% of the CIMMYT collection **(JC: There is a large discrepancy between this figure, from Genesys, and the Crop Trust figure of 73%. I expect one of you has the numbers backwards. MO: There may be a mismatch between ACCENUMB in Genesys and SGSV)** is safety duplicated in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault and there are additional safety duplicates in the United States and Lebanon. In addition, CIMMYT holds safety duplicates for the ICARDA and CIAT genebanks.

CIMMYT's Genetic Resources Program, of which the maize and wheat collections are a part, includes a Seed Health Unit to ensure that all seed meets international phytosanitary standards. A Data Management Unit ensures that data are open access and meet standards of best practice and supports the implementation of [GRIN Global][grin] at CIMMYT and other CGIAR genebanks.  The CIMMYT genebank is ISO9001:2008 certified, and the Seed Health Unit is ISO17025 accredited.
