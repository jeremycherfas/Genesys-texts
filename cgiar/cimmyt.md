# International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT)

[CIMMYT's genebank][cimmyt] in Texcoco, Mexico, primarily houses collections of maize and wheat. The [wheat collection][adobe], with about 140,000 accessions from 140 countries, is the largest in the world. The [maize collection][adobe 2] of 28,000 accessions includes the world's largest collection of maize landraces.

Total holdings in Genesys number more than 164,000. Of these, 47% are advanced cultivars and breeders' lines, 34% are traditional cultivars or landraces, and almost 5% are wild relatives. About 120,000 samples have been distributed to 64 countries.

A key role for the genebank, at CIMMYT as elsewhere, is to identify potentially valuable accessions to use in specific breeding programmes. Most recently, for example, breeders planted 918 landrace accessions to look for [resistance to a disease called tar spot complex][cimmyt 2], which is spreading through Mexico and the USA. Two varieties showed resistance. CIMMYT is now using those varieties to create stocks that breeders can use to produce high-performing resistant varieties.

CIMMYT's accessions have helped to populate two important databases that tabulate molecular characterisation data for wheat and for maize.

About {==37% of the CIMMYT collection==}{>>There is a large discrepancy between this figure, from Genesys, and the Crop Trust figure of 73%. I expect one of you has the numbers backwards. JC<<} is safety duplicated in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault and there are additional safety duplicates in the United States. In addition, CIMMYT holds safety duplicates of material in the ICARDA genebank.

The Genetic Resources Program, of which the genebank is a part, includes a Seed Health Unit to ensure that all seed meets international phytosanitary standards. A Data Management Unit ensures that data are open access and meet standards of best practice.
