# Musa International Transit Centre, Bioversity International

Bioversity's collection of bananas and plantains and their wild relatives (_Musa_ species) is kept at the International Transit Centre (ITC) at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium. The banana collection -- with more than 1500 accessions -- is the largest in the world. About 75% are traditional varieties or landraces and 15% are wild relatives. The remaining 10% is largely breeding and research material.

Accessions are kept [_in-vitro_][bel084-invitro], as 20 shoot cultures in continuous light at 16°C. Fresh cultures are taken each year, and after a few years the tissue culture is replaced with new material grown in the field and checked for genetic integrity. This prevents the accumulation of changes that can occur in plants kept in tissue culture for long periods of time.

Accessions are also [cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen][bel084-cryo] at -196°C. This stops both the growth of plant cells and all biological deterioration, so accessions can be preserved indefinitely and resuscitated into fully viable banana plants. As further insurance, a safety duplicate set is being deposited for safe-keeping at the French research institute for development (IRD) in Montpellier, France.

The ITC is also a global hub for the safe movement of _Musa_ germplasm around the world. It has a system for indexing accessions for the presence of viruses and has researched protocols for cleaning up infected accessions. Only accessions that are virus free -- currently 55% of the collection -- are distributed, and work continues to ensure the entire collection is virus free.

Bioversity maintains the Musa Germplasm Information System ([MGIS][crop-diversity]) with access to information from 12 collections of banana.
