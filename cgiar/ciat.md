# International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT)

[CIAT's genebank][ciat] in Cali, Colombia, lists almost 65,000 accessions in Genesys. The vast majority are seed crops, mainly [beans][col003-beans], but CIAT also has a mandate to conserve [cassava][col003-cassava] and tropical forages, and those too are held in the genebank. Almost 2000 of the accessions are wild relatives. Since 1980 CIAT has distributed more than 90,000 samples of 13,363 accessions to 110 countries.

The CIAT [bean collection][col003-beans] is the world's largest and most diverse, with more than 44,000 accessions. Since it started, the collection has sent more than 437,000 samples of 37,368 accession to recipients in 105 countries. Accessions are contributing to the breeding of more nutritious and more resilient varieties.

Cassava is represented by [6592 accessions][col003-cassava] (883 of which are provided by 33 of the 98 wild relative species of _Manihot_) stored as microplants in tissue culture. This collection too is considered a global leader because of the number of accessions, their diversity and the geographic range they represent. More than 40,000 samples have been distributed, guaranteed free of the three major viruses thanks to the work of the germplasm health laboratory at CIAT. The laboratory also ensures that seeds of beans and tropical forages are free of pests and diseases.

The tropical forage collection is also a world leader, with more than 23,000 accessions of 700 species. CIAT and ILRI created the [Tropical Forages Database](http://www.tropicalforages.info), an online version of an interactive selection tool that helps researchers, farmers and their advisers to find the most appropriate forages.

Two-thirds of the CIAT seed collection is safety duplicated at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault.
