#Coconut
##*Cocos nucifera*

Coconuts are the fruit of a palm and are found throughout the tropics. Coconuts supply many human needs, including food, drink and building materials. Their ability to survive long periods in seawater, and their value to early seafaring people, has resulted in them being widely dispersed.

There are two distinct types, known as *niu kafa* and *niu vai*, the names in Samoan for traditional Polynesian varieties. *Niu kafa* coconuts are triangular and oblong with a large fibrous husk, while *niu vai* types are more rounded and contain plentiful sweet coconut “water” when unripe. *Niu vai* types are often borne on dwarf trees, which suggests that they are more domesticated. However, [a DNA analysis][plos] indicates two independent centres of domestication, one in island Southeast Asia and one on the southern margins of the Indian subcontinent. *Niu vai* types arose only in the Pacific basin.

Genesys lists [168 coconut accessions][goo]. The bulk of these (86%) are in a field genebank at the Station de Recherche Marc Delorme in Ivory Coast, with the remainder in the USA. About 43% are traditional cultivars and landraces and 40% are improved cultivars.

The difficulty of controlling pollination, with the flowers at the top of tall trees, makes it difficult and costly to regenerate field collections as the trees age. Furthermore, field genebanks face external threats from diseases and, potentially, climate change. A plan has been launched to [safeguard the International Coconut Genebank in Papua New Guinea][cogentnetwork] from nearby disease. Research into [cryopreservation of coconut][ishs] is continuing and [shows promise][ishs 2].
