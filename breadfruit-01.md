#Breadfruit
##*Artocarpus* spp

Breadfruit is a large, starchy fruit that grows on trees up to 25 m tall. It gets its name from the texture of the partially-ripe fruit when cooked, which resembles freshly-baked bread. Genesys lists [272 accessions of *Artocarpus* species][https://goo.gl/t4xltE], all but two of them in the USA. The majority (78%) are traditional cultivars and landraces, with about 10% advanced cultivars.

Several members of the genus have edible fruits. The two most common in Genesys are true breadfruit (*A. altilis*) and jackfruit (*A. heterophyllus*). The database also lists several hybrids.

Breadfruit is native to the South Pacific region. Polynesians adopted breadfruit as a staple and first distributed the crop on their travels around the Pacific. Other people then took it further afield, most notably on the infamous [voyage of HMS Bounty][wikipedia].  Jackfruit is believed to have been first cultivated in India and is now found throughout southeast Asia.

Most of the accessions are maintained by [The Breadfruit Institute][ntbg] in a field genebank at the US National Tropical Botanical Garden in Hawaii.
