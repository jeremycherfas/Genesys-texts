Welcome to Genesys, a one stop shop that lets you look at details of more than two and a half million samples of crop diversity. Through Genesys, you can not only find information about genebank accessions but also, in many cases, order samples directly from the genebank.

There are many, many ways to explore the diversity in Genesys. In this video, we're going to focus on one genebank, the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines.

The easiest way to get there is through the list of countries. Click on P and then Philippines and you'll see IRRI at the top of the list, with code PHL001 and more than 127,000 accessions in Genesys.

The entry for IRRI takes you directly to some general information about the IRRI genebank's holdings, almost all of which, not surprisingly, are rice.

The Overview button tells you more about what's in the IRRI genebank, where it came from, what species it is and so on.

Domesticated Asian rice all belongs in the species Oryza sativa. But there is also African rice, domesticated independently. That belongs to the same genus Oryza, but a different species -- glaberrima. Let's take a look at IRRI's accessions of that species on a map.

Under the list of genera, on the left, click on Oryza. Now we can Refine search by category, selecting species. Start typing glaberrima into the search box, and pick the correct one. That gives us a list of more than 5000 accessions. 

Note that if you want to share any list of acessions you've created with a colleague, for example, Genesys provides a special link -- here -- that you can use to get back quickly to a particular set of selections. You can also download your selections and see them on a map. Let's look at the map.

The green dots show where IRRI's accessions of Oryza glaberrima were collected -- mostly in West Africa. Zooming in, we can click on any collecting site to see the accession number and a link directly to information about that accession. 

From the map, you can also download a shapefile to use in any geographic information system.

Let's do that again for a different species.

The back button takes you to the list for Oryza glaberrima. Click on the small x next to the label glaberrima in the filters at the top.

This takes you back to a list of all Oryza accessions. Let's look for Oryza nivara. This is a wild relative that is believed to be one of the ancestors of domesticated Asian rice.

If the Species row is still showing in the list of filters at the top, click anywhere in the row. If it isn't, you'll need to click on Refine search by category and select species again. Type niv in the search box, and you see a menu of possible species. Click on nivara and Apply.

Your list now contains just over 1,400 accessions. The overview shows you that they are kept at IRRI and in two genebanks in the United States. And that most of them were collected in Cambodia and India. You can again look at them on the map and zoom in to see details of each geo-referenced accession.

Of course, you can also use all the other functions of Genesys to search for accessions in the IRRI genebank with particular characteristics. The video tutorial on wheat will show you how to do that. Just apply the same principles after selecting all rice from IRRI.

One final note. You can do all this without logging into Genesys. But if you do create an account and log in, that gives you access to a few additional tools.

And if you come across any problems, or need support, the easiest way to contact Genesys is through Twitter, @genesyspgr. {==Not sure if you want anything like this, or if you feel you will be swamped. But maybe people need to know how to get support.==}
