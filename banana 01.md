#Banana
##*Musa* spp

Banana is one of the most ancient fruit crops. It originated in Southeast Asia and the Pacific region and is believed to have first been domesticated more than 7000 years ago. East and Central Africa are secondary centres of domestication and diversity.

Most cultivated bananas do not produce seeds, so that accessions have to be preserved as tissue cultures and in field genebanks. [Genesys lists 2,443 accessions][goo]. The vast majority are held at the International Transit Centre in Belgium, with smaller collections in Australia, Nigeria and USA.

Because bananas are multiplied vegetatively, all the individuals in a plantation may be genetically identical clones. This makes banana plantations highly susceptible to outbreaks of pests and diseases. The threat to internationally-traded varieties from new races of pathogen has created worldwide alarm and a drive to breed and engineer resistant varieties. However, the risk is even greater locally in the tropics, where bananas may be the most important staple.

Another target of banana breeding is to create varieties that offer better nutrition. This is especially important where bananas are a staple crop, often used to wean children onto solid food. Efforts are focused on [increasing levels of vitamin A precursors][promusa] to combat deficiency diseases.

Genebank accessions were instrumental in [sequencing the banana genome][cirad], completed in 2012. [Genomic information is available][southgreen] for use by researchers.

About 11% of the accessions listed in Genesys are wild relatives. While the fruit of most of these is inedible, they are very important in efforts to breed new varieties.
