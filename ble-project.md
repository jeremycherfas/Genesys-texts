## New project: linking phenotypes to accessions

The Trust has prepared a project proposal that will make life much easier for plant breeders by connecting the wealth of characterization and evaluation data to details of genebank accessions. The Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE) in Germany has given the project a very favourable initial reception.

At the moment, researchers generate large amounts of data when they undertake seed multiplication, accession regeneration and screening, among other activities. While this information is useful to the researchers concerned, it could be crucially important to other researchers working on the same crops or problems. The difficulty is that the results of phenotypic characterisation is often not connected to the genetic resources that were characterised.

One difficulty in making phenotypic characterisation more widely available is that the data can be much more complex and multi-layered than, say, genotypic data. Another is that the same material can often be identified in different ways by different institutions. Finally, the few genebanks that do share their phenotypic datasets, do so using different structures and formats for their data.

The new project will focus on the latter two problems. It will promote the widespread adoption of permanent unique identifiers (PUID) for genebank accessions and it will ensure that metadata are collected for available phenotypic datasets, thus accurately describing the underlying structure of the dataset. This in turn will help information providers to improve the quality of their primary data.

Making phenotypic data available alongside genomic data, and linking both to a specific accession, will greatly increase the value of the information compiled by [DivSeek](http://www.divseek.org) as it seeks to unlock the potential of crop diversity stored in genebanks around the globe. It will also be an important contribution to the Multilateral System established under the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Reosurces for Food and Agriculture.

While we await confirmation that BLE will fund the project, we are confident that we will go ahead and will complete the initial phase by early 2018.
