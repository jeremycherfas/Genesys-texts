## Welcome aboard EMBRAPA
Readers may have seen the announcement after the Crop Trust pledging conference that Brazil is keen to strengthen its relationship with the Trust and with the global system.

To that end, Genesys is working closely with Embrapa, the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply, to ensure that data from [Alelo](http://alelobag.cenargen.embrapa.br), the Brazilian genetic resources database, is available through Genesys.

Embrapa's long-term collection covers about 120,000 accessions of 222 genera. The active genebanks of the country as a whole contain about 300,000 accessions.[^1] Bringing even a part of these into Genesys will be a significant enlargement of its value to users.
