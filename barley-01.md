# Barley
## *Hordeum* spp

Barley was first domesticated in the area called the Fertile Crescent, where its wild progenitor *Hordeum vulgare* subsp. *spontaneum* still grows. Other centres of diversity of cultivated barley are found in Ethiopia and Morocco and parts of Asia. Wild relatives are distributed widely in  Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas.

The importance of barley as one of the original staple cereals is reflected in the number of accessions in Genesys: [more than 176,000](https://goo.gl/95A238). Most of the accessions in Genesys are advanced material, including released cultivars and research lines. About 22% are traditional varieties and landraces. Accessions are widely distributed, with the largest collection holding only a third of the listed accessions.

Barley is grown from arctic latitudes to tropical areas and from sea level to high altitudes. In Tibet, Nepal, Ethiopia and the Andes, farmers cultivate barley on the mountain slopes at elevations higher than any other cereals. Barley predominates in the dry lands of North Africa, the Middle East, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Eritrea and Yemen.

With such a widespread distribution, and with diverse uses that include human food, animal feed and as a raw material for alcoholic beverages, barley is the fourth most important cereal in the world.
