## A revamped website

The Genesys website is undergoing a facelift and, more importantly, the way it works behind the scenes is being significantly improved.

> "Over time, as we have added new features to make Genesys more useful, the site has become a little disorganised," said Matija Obreza, who is leading the revamp. "So we are going back and rethinking how we present the information."

The goal, Matija says, it to make the experience of looking for, finding and then ordering germplasm of interest as easy and seamless as possible.

So far the redesign has focussed on the design of the user interface and on making the content more accessible. New content and guides on how to use Genesys will also be prepared.

Pages now present more information, more attractively. Accessions can be filtered on multiple criteria simply by checking a box. Visitors can see images, where appropriate, passport data and information about the accession and its collecting history. Presentation of information about institutes has also been clarified and improved.

Progress is good, and the new website should be ready for launch in October.
