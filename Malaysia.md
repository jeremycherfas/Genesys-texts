# Malaysia

Malaysia is registered as the country of origin for 6361 accessions in Genesys.

## *Ex-situ* conservation

The Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (MARDI) operates two genebanks, in Seberang Perai, Penang, and Serdang, Selangor. The latter is in the process of becoming the national genebank. Other institutes maintain collections of species of interest, often as field genebanks. Collections include rice, fruits, medicinal plants, biopesticidal plants, ornamental plants and underutilized species.

MARDI's genebanks contain about 13,000 accessions of rice and 2,000 accessions of 69 vegetable species.

Collecting missions by MARDI, the Department of Agriculture and the World Vegetable Center over the past few years have succeeded in adding 1170 accessions of 54 species to the various seed and field genebanks.

## On-farm conservation

A project funded by the Global Environment Facility of the United Nations Environment Programme considerably strengthened on-farm conservation in Malaysia. The project focused on fruit trees in six sites and included community-based management, documentation and characterization of traditional varieties and the role of fruit trees in nutrition and incomes. (See project report at [Tropical Fruit Trees](http://www.bioversityinternational.org/research-portfolio/conservation-use-of-bananas-tree-crops/tropical-fruit-trees/))

## Policies

Malaysia is a Party to the International Treaty. The country adopted a National Strategies and Action Plans on Agricultural Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Utilisation, revised in 2012. The NSAP includes priorities for collecting missions to conserve threatened PGRFA.

## Information systems

Malaysia implemented a National Information Sharing Mechanism for PGRFA. Data are updated frequently and make use of standardized formats. In addition Malaysia has also developed other information systems to support conservation and sustainable use of PGRFA, including [AgrobIS](http://agrobis.mardi.gov.my/about_us.php) for rice, fruits, vegetables and herbs.
